== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this sidebar plugin work with my theme? =

Yes!

If your theme already has WordPress sidebars and widget areas, you can create new custom sidebars to replace, merge with or hide those on certain conditions.

You can also display custom sidebars using the sidebar shortcode [ca-sidebar id=""] anywhere in your content.

If your theme has a built-in sidebar generator, it is recommended to disable it and/or only use Content Aware Sidebars for maximum speed and compatibility.

= Will this plugin work with page builders? =

Yes!

Many users already mix Content Aware Sidebars with popular page builder plugins such as Elementor, SiteOrigin Page Builder, Beaver Builder, and Visual Composer.

= Can I really display sidebars and widget areas on any page? =

Yep.

In the Sidebar Editor, you can select where, when and to whom your sidebar should be displayed. Create a sidebar for each page, a sidebar for posts in a category, or any sidebar you need, without confusing widget logic code.

You can also select sidebars directly when you're editing a post or page.
